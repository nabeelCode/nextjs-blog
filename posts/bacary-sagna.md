Smith Rowe has been in sensational form for the Gunners so far this season, having already picked up **four goals and two assists** in the north London club’s opening 11 Premier League matches.

Those performances helped him earn his first call-up to Gareth Southgate’s England squad for the most recent World Cup qualifiers against Albania and San Marino, starting and **scoring** against the latter in a comprehensive 10-0 victory.

When signing a new long-term contract at Arsenal in the summer, the 20-year-old boldly **asked to wear the No.10 jersey for the upcoming campaign**, a shirt previously worn by club legends such as Dennis Bergkamp, Robin Van Persie, Jack Wilshere and Mesut Ozil.

And former Arsenal and Manchester City right-back Sagna has admitted that he thought the decision to wear such a prestigious jersey would turn out to be a mistake.

‘He’s been amazing. He’s been impressing me a lot. **Initially I wasn’t sure about Arsenal giving him the number 10, I thought it was a bit early, but he’s mature for his age and shown he deserves it**,’ he exclusively told Metro.co.uk via freebets.com.

‘Sometimes when you have players wearing the No.10, they think they’ve made it already and I was worried about him having too much pressure, and how he would deal with it.
